            <br>
            <b>The Flashcard Mode in this application provides an interactive way to study and reinforce knowledge. Users can cycle through a deck of flashcards using the Previous and Next buttons, allowing them to review each card at their own pace. Each flashcard displays a definition, prompting users to recall and guess the corresponding term before revealing the answer. This mode is perfect for self-paced learning, helping users strengthen their memory and retention of key concepts.</b>

            <br>
            <b>Learn Mode transforms studying into an interactive challenge by presenting a definition and four randomized term choices, requiring users to select the correct answer. This active recall approach reinforces learning while keeping users engaged. The program tracks progress within each study set, allowing users to resume where they left off or reset their progress for a fresh start. Whether you're preparing for an exam or reinforcing key concepts, Learn Mode provides a structured and effective way to master your material.</b>
